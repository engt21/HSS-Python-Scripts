Description: Unfortunately, due to copyright limitations, I cannot post the code for the script. However, I will give a brief high-level description. I used several Python libraries, including csv, xml, and pandas to process/convert all outgoing patient survey data (several hundred thousand per year) so that it could be more easily analyzed in the future by data scientists at HSS. It is able to process around 50-60 patient survey results in about 5 seconds, with many data cells per person.
